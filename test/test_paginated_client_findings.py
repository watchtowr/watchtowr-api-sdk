The response from the back-end request is returned in the application's front-end response, allowing an attacker to browse internal and restricted systems.\n\nSpecific to this vulnerability, this SSRF would allow an attacker to access the PowerShell Remoting service typically available to an exchange server. This could then be abused by an attacker to perform object deserialization and conversion operations outlined in CVE-2022-41082, leading to remote code execution.","impact":"If discovered and exploited by an attacker, it may be possible to;\n\n* Abuse the SSRF vulnerability to invoke PowerShell Remoting, which may be further exploited to gain RCE on the vulnerable Exchange via object deserialization\n* Access other backend services available to the Exchange server","finding_impact":"Prioritised Findings","tags":[{"id":4,"name":"Credentials"}],"evidence":"Affected URL: http://autodiscover.watchtowr.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.json?@2GAQpUSRSmGb9sbrpz8K7OxI1iC.com/%50owershell?=&Email=autodiscover/autodiscover.json?@2GAQpUSRSmGb9sbrpz8K7OxI1iC.com\n\n","recommendation":"It is recommended that the affected instance of Microsoft Exchange be upgraded to a version that includes a patch for CVE-2022-41040.\n\nThe vulnerability has been addressed in the following Microsoft Updates:\n* Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Cumulative Update 23\n* Microsoft Exchange Server 2019 Cumulative Update 12\n* Microsoft Exchange Server 2019 Cumulative Update 11\n* Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Cumulative Update 22\n* Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 23","references":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:U/RC:R","severity":"high","status":"confirmed","affected":{"data":{"type":"subdomain","source":"module-adversarysight-subdomain-general-bruteforce-gobuster","status":"verified","created_at":"2022-09-24T21:05:46.000Z","updated_at":"2023-12-28T22:01:05.000Z","deleted_at":null,"id":"43","name":"autodiscover.watchtowr.com","businessUnits":[],"live":false}},"cve_id":"CVE-2022-41040","epss_score":"0.965310000","retest_history":[{"requested_by":"User Name","requested_at":"2024-01-29T06:36:52.000Z","retest_status":"in-progress","completed_at":null,"evidence":"No evidences"}],"assigned_user":null}],
